This is the personal portfolio website of Seth Cohen. It is a static, public-facing site designed to showcase my work, research, and interests as a developer, HCI researcher, and digital creative. The code is open for transparency and learning, but is not intended for reuse, customization, or outside contribution.

**There are no plans to support customization, theming, or community contributions.**

### What You'll Find Here

- My professional and creative portfolio projects
- An overview of my technical skills and tech stack
- A personal introduction and background
- Contact and support information

### Tech Stack

- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **Vite** (build tooling)
- **Tailwind CSS** (custom dark/gray + gold palette)

### Why Is This Public?

- For transparency and to share how the site is built
- As a reference for recruiters, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work
- To demonstrate my approach to design, accessibility, and modern frontend development
